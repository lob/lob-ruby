  # unit tests for check_cancel
  # cancel
  # Completely removes a check from production. This can only be done if the check has a &#x60;send_date&#x60; and the &#x60;send_date&#x60; has not yet passed. If the check is successfully canceled, you will not be charged for it. Read more on [cancellation windows](#section/Cancellation-Windows) and [scheduling](#section/Scheduled-Mailings). Scheduling and cancellation is a premium feature. Upgrade to the appropriate [Print &amp; Mail Edition](https://dashboard.lob.com/#/settings/editions) to gain access.

  # @param [Hash] opts the optional parameters
  # @option opts [Integer] :limit How many results to return.
  # @option opts [String] :before A reference to a list entry used for paginating to the previous set of entries. This field is pre-populated in the &#x60;previous_url&#x60; field in the return response.
