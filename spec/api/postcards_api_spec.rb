  # unit tests for postcard_delete
  # cancel
  # Completely removes a postcard from production. This can only be done if the postcard has a &#x60;send_date&#x60; and the &#x60;send_date&#x60; has not yet passed. If the postcard is successfully canceled, you will not be charged for it. Read more on [cancellation windows](#section/Cancellation-Windows) and [scheduling](#section/Scheduled-Mailings). Scheduling and cancellation is a premium feature. Upgrade to the appropriate [Print &amp; Mail Edition](https://dashboard.lob.com/#/settings/editions) to gain access.

  # list
  # Returns a list of your postcards. The addresses are returned sorted by creation date, with the most recently created addresses appearing first.
  # @param [Hash] opts the optional parameters
  # @option opts [Integer] :limit How many results to return.
  # @option opts [String] :before A reference to a list entry used for paginating to the previous set of entries. This field is pre-populated in the &#x60;previous_url&#x60; field in the return response. 
  # @option opts [String] :after A reference to a list entry used for paginating to the next set of entries. This field is pre-populated in the &#x60;next_url&#x60; field in the return response. 
  # @option opts [Array<String>] :include Request that the response include the total count by specifying &#x60;include[]&#x3D;total_count&#x60;.
