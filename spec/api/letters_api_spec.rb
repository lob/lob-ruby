  # unit tests for letter_cancel
  # cancel
  # Completely removes a letter from production. This can only be done if the letter has a &#x60;send_date&#x60; and the &#x60;send_date&#x60; has not yet passed. If the letter is successfully canceled, you will not be charged for it. Read more on [cancellation windows](#section/Cancellation-Windows) and [scheduling](#section/Scheduled-Mailings). Scheduling and cancellation is a premium feature. Upgrade to the appropriate [Print &amp; Mail Edition](https://dashboard.lob.com/#/settings/editions) to gain access.
