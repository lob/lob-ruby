For example, if you have a template like: &#x60;{{variable_name}}&#x60;, pass in &#x60;{\&quot;variable_name\&quot;: \&quot;Harry\&quot;}&#x60; to render &#x60;Harry&#x60;. &#x60;merge_variables&#x60; must be an object. Any type of value is accepted as long as the object is valid JSON; you can use &#x60;strings&#x60;, &#x60;numbers&#x60;, &#x60;booleans&#x60;, &#x60;arrays&#x60;, &#x60;objects&#x60;, or &#x60;null&#x60;.

More instructions can be found in [our guide to using html and merge variables](https://lob.com/resources/guides/general/using-html-and-merge-variables). Depending on your [Merge Variable strictness](https://dashboard.lob.com/#/settings/account) setting, if you define variables in your HTML but do not pass them here, you will either receive an error or the variable will render as an empty string. | [optional] |
| **send_date** | **Time** | A timestamp in ISO 8601 format which specifies a date after the current time and up to 180 days in the future to send the letter off for production. Setting a send date overrides the default [cancellation window](#section/Cancellation-Windows) applied to the mailpiece. Until the &#x60;send_date&#x60; has passed, the mailpiece can be canceled. If a date in the format &#x60;2017-11-01&#x60; is passed, it will evaluate to midnight UTC of that date (&#x60;2017-11-01T00:00:00.000Z&#x60;). If a datetime is passed, that exact time will be used. A &#x60;send_date&#x60; passed with no time zone will default to UTC, while a &#x60;send_date&#x60; passed with a time zone will be converted to UTC. | [optional] |
| **color** | **Boolean** | Set this key to &#x60;true&#x60; if you would like to print in color. Set to &#x60;false&#x60; if you would like to print in black and white. |  |

| **return_envelope** | [**AnyType**](.md) | indicates if a return envelope is requested for the letter. The value corresponding to this field is by default a boolean. But if the account is signed up for custom return envelopes, the value is of type string and is &#x60;no_9_single_window&#x60; for a standard return envelope and a custom &#x60;return_envelope_id&#x60; for non-standard return envelopes.  To include a return envelope with your letter, set to &#x60;true&#x60; and specify the &#x60;perforated_page&#x60;.
