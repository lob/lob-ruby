See [Metadata](#section/Metadata) for more information. | [optional] |
| **merge_variables** | **Object** | You can input a merge variable payload object to your template to render dynamic content. For example, if you have a template like: &#x60;{{variable_name}}&#x60;, pass in &#x60;{\&quot;variable_name\&quot;: \&quot;Harry\&quot;}&#x60; to render &#x60;Harry&#x60;. &#x60;merge_variables&#x60; must be an object. Any type of value is accepted as long as the object is valid JSON; you can use &#x60;strings&#x60;, &#x60;numbers&#x60;, &#x60;booleans&#x60;, &#x60;arrays&#x60;, &#x60;objects&#x60;, or &#x60;null&#x60;.

More instructions can be found in [our guide to using html and merge variables](https://lob.com/resources/guides/general/using-html-and-merge-variables). Depending on your [Merge Variable strictness](https://dashboard.lob.com/#/settings/account) setting, if you define variables in your HTML but do not pass them here, you will either receive an error or the variable will render as an empty string. | [optional] |
| **send_date** | **Time** | A timestamp in ISO 8601 format which specifies a date after the current time and up to 180 days in the future to send the letter off for production. Setting a send date overrides the default [cancellation window](#section/Cancellation-Windows) applied to the mailpiece. Until the &#x60;send_date&#x60; has passed, the mailpiece can be canceled. If a date in the format &#x60;2017-11-01&#x60; is passed, it will evaluate to midnight UTC of that date (&#x60;2017-11-01T00:00:00.000Z&#x60;). If a datetime is passed, that exact time will be used. A &#x60;send_date&#x60; passed with no time zone will default to UTC, while a &#x60;send_date&#x60; passed with a time zone will be converted to UTC. | [optional] |
| **extra_service** | **String** | Add an extra service to your letter. See [pricing](https://www.lob.com/pricing/print-mail#compare) for extra costs incurred. | [optional] |
| **tracking_number** | **String** | The tracking number, if applicable, will appear here when it becomes available. Dummy tracking numbers are not created in test mode. | [optional] |
| **tracking_events** | [**Array&lt;TrackingEventNormal&gt;**](TrackingEventNormal.md) | Tracking events are not populated for registered or regular (no extra service) letters. | [optional] |
| **return_address** | [**AnyType**](.md) | Specifies the address the return envelope will be sent back to. This is an optional argument that is available if an account is signed up for the return envelope tracking beta, and has &#x60;return_envelope&#x60;, and &#x60;perforated_page&#x60; fields populated in the API request. | [optional] |
| **mail_type** | [**MailType**](MailType.md) |  | [optional][default to &#39;usps_first_class&#39;] |
| **color** | **Boolean** | Set this key to &#x60;true&#x60; if you would like to print in color. Set to &#x60;false&#x60; if you would like to print in black and white. | [optional] |
| **double_sided** | **Boolean** | Set this attribute to &#x60;true&#x60; for double sided printing, or &#x60;false&#x60; for for single sided printing. Defaults to &#x60;true&#x60;. | [optional][default to true] |
| **address_placement** | **String** | Specifies the location of the address information that will show through the double-window envelope.  | [optional][default to &#39;top_first_page&#39;] |
| **return_envelope** | [**AnyType**](.md) |  |  |
| **perforated_page** | **Integer** | Required if &#x60;return_envelope&#x60; is &#x60;true&#x60;. The number of the page that should be perforated for use with the return envelope. Must be greater than or equal to &#x60;1&#x60;. The blank page added by &#x60;address_placement&#x3D;insert_blank_page&#x60; will be ignored when considering the perforated page number. To see how perforation will impact your letter design, view our [perforation guide](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/public.lob.com/assets/templates/letter_perf_template.pdf). | [optional] |
| **custom_envelope** | [**LetterCustomEnvelope**](LetterCustomEnvelope.md) |  | [optional] |
