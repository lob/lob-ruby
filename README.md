# lob-ruby

Ruby wrapper for the [Lob.com](http://lob.com) API. This gem gives you an ActiveRecord-style syntax to use the Lob.com API.

Supports Ruby 1.9.3 and greater.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's `Gemfile`:

    gem 'lob'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install lob

## Usage

The library uses an ActiveRecord-style interface. You'll feel right at home.
You'll need a Lob.com API key. It's free and you can get yours [here](https://www.lob.com/account).

For optional parameters and other details, refer the docs here - <https://lob.com/docs>

#### Caution: Pass zero-prefixed zip codes as strings

When using zip codes with zero-prefixes, always quote them. For example when specifying `02125`, pass it as a string `"02125"`, instead of an integer.

The Ruby interpreter assumes it's not of base-10 and tries to convert it to base-10 number. So that might result in an entirely different zip-code than intended.

### Initialization and configuration

```ruby
# To initialize a Lob object
@lob = Lob(api_key: "your-api-key")


# Alternatively, to set the API key for all calls in the future
Lob.api_key = "you-api-key"
@lob = Lob()   # don't forget the paranthesis!
```

#### Or if you want some detailed configuration

```ruby
Lob.configure do |config|
  config.api_key = "your-api-key"  # get your own at http://lob.com :)
  config.api_version = "v1"        # default version
  config.protocol = "https"        # default protocol
  config.api_host = "api.lob.com"  # ofcourse it's Lob
end
```

## Developing

Make sure you have Ruby 2.0 installed. Copy and paste the following commands in your projects directory.

    git clone https://github.com/lob/lob-ruby.git
    cd lob-ruby
    bundle install

You are powered up and ready to roll ~!

## Running the test-suite

To run the tests, download the required sample files by running the following command:

    bundle exec rake dev:setup

Tests are written using MiniTest, a testing library that comes with Ruby stdlib. The remote responses are tested using [vcr](https://github.com/vcr/vcr).

You'll need to pass in your Lob.com API as the environment variable `LOB_API_KEY`, to run the tests. Be sure to use your Test API key, and not the Live one.

Here's how you can run the tests:

    LOB_API_KEY=your_test_api_key bundle exec rake test
